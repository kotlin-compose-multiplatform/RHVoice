# Privacy Policy

The following information applies to RHVoice, a speech synthesizer developed by
Olga Yakovleva. Its source code is published at
<https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice>.

RHVoice may use third-party services that collect personal information. This
document will list such services and explain when they are used. If you use the
corresponding functionality of RHVoice, you agree to the terms and conditions
stated in the privacy policies of those services.

RHVoice itself collects no personal information.

After RHVoice converts a piece of text into speech, it forgets about this text:
no part of the text or the generated speech is kept by RHVoice.

Speech synthesis is performed locally, on the user's device, without
transferring any part of the text or the generated speech to a remote server.

The RHVoice app for Android uses
[Linode Object Storage](https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/),
a third-party hosting service, to host its language and voice data files.
When you choose to install a voice and RHVoice downloads the necessary files
from Object Storage, Linode may
collect your metadata, such as your IP address. Please see Linode's
[Privacy Policy](https://www.linode.com/legal-privacy/) for more details.
